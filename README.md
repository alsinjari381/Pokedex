# Pokedex
As of now, this project has dubious usefulness unless you happen to search up type resistances a lot while playing Pokemon, 
and using the internet is needlessly slow(as it is for me). I'm hoping to expand this project to have a GUI and possibly an automatic overlay if I can.
If you do want to use this proj though, just download and compile the two files, place both in the same directory, run database_constructor.py first, then
database_viewer.py
